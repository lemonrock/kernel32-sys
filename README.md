# kernel32-sys

This crate is a shim replacement for the junkware shite that is the real kernel32-sys crate and its deeply broken dependency winapi-build written by some Windows fanboy-aegit. Why, in the name of all that is sensible, does that crate run a build script on a Linux system? This makes cross-compiling on Alpine Linux using a patchelf'd rustc that uses glibc (uggh) (because the rust core team _still_ haven't delivered a statically linked musl binary after over a year because of arcane conversations and a lack of experience with devops). And because cargo doesn't make it easy to override rustc just for build scripts. Tried to get the idea through the developer's head, have given up.
